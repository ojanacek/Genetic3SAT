# 3SAT optimization problem

Genetic algorithm solution for optimization 3SAT problem. Instead of just evaluating satisfiability it's looking for the best possible solution considering weights of all variables.

Supports DIMACS CNF file format, weights are randomly generated and added by WeightsGenerator as after the last comment line, right before preamble.
